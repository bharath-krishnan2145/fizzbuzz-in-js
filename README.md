# FizzBuzz Problem

## Overview

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic programming challenge often used in coding interviews. The task is to print the numbers from 1 to 100, but with a twist:

- For multiples of **three**, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number.
- For multiples of **five**, print `"Buzz"` instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of **both** three and five, print `"FizzBuzz"`.

## Implementation

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the FizzBuzz problem. The program takes a range of numbers as input and prints the appropriate output based on the rules outlined above.

### Example Output

For an input range of 1 to 15, the output will be:

1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fizzbuzz-js.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd fizzbuzz-js
3. Run the script using Node.js:
  node fizzbuzz.js
